## Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp Projects

### This repository contains projects and challenges that i've completed in association with the Thinkful DS Bootcamp. These projects are generally less detailed than the capstone projects and are a place for me to practice skills that I have learned in the course material.

### Projects in this repository:
* Predicting home sales prices in Ames, IA using linear regression
* Predicting the drinkablity of water using logistic regression, KNN Classifiers, SVC, and Random forests
